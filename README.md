# Experiments

All experiments are stored under "pca_analysis/experiments/notebooks/" with an "experiments" dir for daily (or so) EDA work, and a "notes" dir for more concise summaries of observations, interpretations, important information. For example, some EDA started on 2024-09-02 will be under "experiments", but a summary of it and say work from 2024-09-04 will be in "notes". It would be useful to link the related EDA notebooks in the summaries..
