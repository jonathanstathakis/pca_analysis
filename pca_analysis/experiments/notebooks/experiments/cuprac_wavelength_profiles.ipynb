    "conclusion: \"There aer key clusters centered around 360 and 1000, with minor clusters following. Baseline rises and falls, returning to origin at ~4000. There is a step trough across all samples at ~4700 which may be the elution of undissolved CUPRAC reagent. There are two wavelength maxima - 310 and 450 nm. 310 may be underivatised analytes, 450 can be attributed to derivatised analytes. Use 450 nm for CUPRAC analysis as per literature.\"\n",

    "We want to observe trends in the 'cuprac' dataset to find the representative wavelength. The absorbance profile changes over time and over wavelength modes. There is clustering due to analytes of similar chemistry eluting at similar times. We can also assume that these analytes have similar chromophores, thus having similar profiles within the wavelength mode. So if looking for general trends, it is safe to aggregate regions in time into bins. We thus reduce the 3D surface to a series of 3D lines, preferably less than five. This aggregation has the advantage of not being overly affected by convolution as for equal levels of convolution, all aggregations will be equally tainted. Selection of Selection of the start and end points of those bins should be done based on the 256 and 450 nm profiles in raw and CUPRAC, respectively. The samples will be the samples with the highest average absorbance at those wavelengths.\n"

    "#### General Profile Description\n",
    "\n",
    "First the general CUPRAC profile across a range of samples was observed. Generally speaking the separation is centered around the 1000th idx with peak clusters at 360 to 770 prior to the maxima, and a long range from the maxima to ~2800 containing minor peak clusters. The baseline gently returns to origin by ~ 4000th idx. Following this is a severe drop at ~4730 which may be the end of the CUPRAC reagent elution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Bin Aggregations over Wavelength \n",
    "\n",
    "There appears to be a consistant maxima at 244nm , increasing in intensity along the time domain, an inversely proportional trough at 310nm, then another expected maxima at 450 nm. The last maxima is not directly proportional to time, with bin 3 possessing the highest average, and bins 0, 5 and 6 possessing almost zero average absorbance at that point. This is expected as those bins possess no peaks. Therefore the 244 peak is either uneluted analyte or solvent."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    " \n",
    "The general profile over a sampling of wines at 450 nm and time bin sample aggregations over all wavelengths was observed, described and intepreted. The general profile consists of two key clusters containing a minor and major maxima at idx 360 and 1000 respectively, with minor clusters following until baseline return at ~ 4000. Another key feature is the presence of a steep trough at ~4700 which is attributed to the end of the CUPRAC reagent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorbance by wavelength profile of 7 manually defined time aggregations across a sampling was observed. It was determined that there are three key maxima - two positive at 244 nm and 450 nm, and one negative at 310. The first positive maxima increases then sharply decreases over time, and is presumably correlated to underivatised sample, the second positive maxima increases and more gently decreases over time, corresponding to the peak profile of the chromatogram, with a maximum within bin 3. The negative trough is extreme, occuring at 310nm, and is presumably transmission from undissolved CUPRAC reagent. Note that some bins contain a much higher baseline than others, and once that is accounted for the results may be quite different. Furthermore, we require an explanation of the CURPAC profile terms of the solvent and cuprac gradients to fully understand the mechanism."
