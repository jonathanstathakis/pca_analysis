    "In [Migrating From DuckDB to NetCDF](export_data_from_db.ipynb), we found that in order to export the data to NetCDF from the SQL database its currently in, we need to ensure that the key dimensions align. What this means is that every sample needs to have the same wavelength and time values for rows/columns. This is because the magic of NetCDF/XArray is to share as many dimensions as possible. If I don't do this, the dataset will become too large for memory as it tries to fit all the different time points in. See \n",
