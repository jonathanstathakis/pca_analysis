    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key tables: 'sample_metadata' and 'chromatogram_spectra_long', with, respectively, the most important sample metadata, and chromatospectral images of each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "[sample_metadata](#sample-metadata) possesses 8 columns: 'detection', 'acq_date', 'wine', 'color', 'varietal', 'samplecode, 'id', and 'sample_num', with both 'id' and 'sample_num' as primary keys - 'id' is a UUID derived from a hash, and 'sample_num' is a monotonically ascending key ordered by sample acquisition date.\n",
    "\n",
    "[chromatogram_spectra_long](#chromatogram-spectra-long) consists of 173,048,494 rows and the following 5 columns: 'idx', 'id', 'mins', 'wavelength', and 'absorbance', with 'id' as the primary key, same as 'sample_metadata'. 'idx'/'mins' ranges from 0 to 15599, 'wavelength' from 190 to 600 with 205 unique values, steps of 2 between each, absorbance ranges from ~-3596 to ~2918. The wide range of 'idx/'mins' indicates an outlier as *a priori* we know that the samples usually run around 4800 observations. Furthermore, absorbances should not venture far beyond -0, indicating more outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "It  appears that chromatogram_spectra_long contains either duplicated samples OR samples observed at ~2x the frequency of the *a priori* known 2.5Hz rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue, we should investigate the lengths and frequency of each sample and the absorbance ranges.\n"
