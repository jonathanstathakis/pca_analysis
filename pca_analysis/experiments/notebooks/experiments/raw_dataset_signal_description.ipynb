    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The chromatographic profile at 256nm across samples and a sample aggregation across manually defined time bins across all wavelengths were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chromatographic profile varies significantly by sample but can be summarised as possessing a key peak region between idx 0 and 600, followed by a third at ~1200. Clusters occur throughout the remainder of the elution profile with some samples possesing key clusters at ~3200 and ~3800. The baseline rises slowly after the first cluster reaching a maximum around 1800 before returning to origin at ~4200. There is a feature attributable to the methanol purge at ~6300. See the description of the experimental design for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the aggregated spectral profile, we found that it is consistent across the selected time bins, meaning that no wavelength is superior for a given time range. It is however difficult to determine an optimal observation wavelength for all samples  and times from aggregated spectral profiles alone as no distinct maxima occurs.\n"
