    "description: \"a demonstration of use of baseline correction estimators and their performance on the 0 - 100 idx subset of the shiraz dataset.\"\n",
    "status: \"closed\"\n",
    "conclusion: \"Two estimators were developed: ASLS and SNIP. They were able to transform the data. A SQL based results data model was developed with a class based api able to provide visusalisations of the results in 2 and 3D. It was observed that the subset did not require baseline subtraction. ASLS overfit the data, especially convoluted peaks. SNIP performed very poorly without a baseline on the right side of the signal, indicating that it is unsuitable for busy signals.\"\n",

    "It should first be stated that for the dataset range idx 0 - 100 that baseline correction is unnecessary. That being said, it is clear that ASLS is inclined to overfit convooluted peaks, and that SNIP performs very poorly if a baseline is not present on both sides of the signal. SNIP is thus unsuitable for highly packed signals, and that overall baseline correction should be restricted to the entire signal interval rather than subset by subset, and that a generous baseline should be included on either end."
